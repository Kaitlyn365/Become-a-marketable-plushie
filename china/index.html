  <h2>Become a Plushie if you're from the People's Republic of China</h2>
<p>Lately, our admin team has noticed that the site where you can become your desired you is blocked in the People's Republic of China due to being a Google Form. If you live in the PRC, have no fear! You can still become a plushie by sending a DM to <a href=https://discord.com/users/1246188680478199881>our discord</a>. In this case, you will have to use a VPN. We may set up something more formal later.</p>
