  <h2>Become your desired self!</h2>
<p>Here at S.T.A.R. Labs, you can become your desired OC or fursona if you are not satisfied with your current body! (WARNING: this is life-changing. Think twice before you proceed.)</p>

<p>Becoming your OC/fursona is 100% free. When you schedule a plushification appointment, you must provide an OC, fursona, or something else so we know what you should look like after the transformation.
There is no need to drive to S.T.A.R. Labs in NJ; One of our subjects has applied for a job here as their new body can teleport people. You may also cancel your appointment any time, up until thirty minutes before your scheduled appointment.</p>

<p>You will remain sentient after plushification; you will just be... well.. different. You will also be able to continue your life as (mostly) usual.</p>

<p>You may, if you so desire, make this process permanent. Permanence is completely optional. But beware! Permanence is irreversible so be ready for a life-changing process if you choose for this to be permanent.</p>

<a href="https://forms.gle/whhAzoAHstkGvKfB8"><img src=/Become-a-Plushie-The-Website/Schedule.png>click here to apply.</a>

<p>If you live in the People's Republic of China and want to become your desired self, go <a href=/Become-a-marketable-plushie/china/>here</a>.</p>
