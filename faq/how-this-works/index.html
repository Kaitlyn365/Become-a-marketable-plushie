  <h2>How plushification works</h2>
<p>Yea so basically your consciousness is copied onto a hard drive in case of emergency, then your body is put in a machine and turned into your desired self. the machine has an auto backup function that copies your DNA just in case you want to undo all this. And then we start the machine, which your consciousness is then injected into, completing the transformation. You will wake up and most likely feel dizzy for a few minutes.
Your memory will go blank for around 10 seconds, which is your mind being reprogrammed to adapt to your new body. But don't worry! You'll remember everything when those 10 seconds are up. </p>
